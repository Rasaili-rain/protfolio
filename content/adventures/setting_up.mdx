# My First Next.js Adventure

Welcome to my first coding adventure! Today, I'm sharing my experience building this very blog you're reading.

## Why Next.js?

I chose **Next.js** for several compelling reasons:

- Server-side rendering for better SEO
- Built-in routing system
- Excellent developer experience
- Great performance out of the box

## Setting Up MDX

MDX allows me to write markdown with React components embedded. Here's a simple example:

```jsx
export const Greeting = ({ name }) => <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>

<Greeting name="World" />
```

## Convinient
All the adventures are dynamically loaded from the content/ folder
```bash
❯ tree content
content
└── adventures
    ├── images_gifs_and_videos.mdx
    └── setting_up.mdx

2 directories, 2 files
```



### The Benefits

1. **Rich content**: Mix markdown with interactive components
2. **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support
3. **Flexibility**: Use any React component in your content

## Code Highlighting

The syntax highlighting works beautifully:

```typescript
interface Adventure {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  date: string;
  readTime: string;
  tags: string[];
}

const loadAdventures = async (): Promise<Adventure[]> => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/adventures');
  return response.json();
}
```


```rust 
fn main(){
  println!("hello world");
}
```
